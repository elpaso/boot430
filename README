DESCRIPTION:

. boot430 is usb bootloader for certain (8k and 16k) msp430g2xxx value line devices.
. based on bbusb (for bit-bang usb), a v-usb like low-speed usb implementaion on msp430
. requires a minimal component circuit and is very breadboard friendly.
. can be used for other usb implementations, by replacing bbusb_prototcol.c and main()
. there are many alternate h/w hookups, research "v-usb 3.3v"
. compile w/ mspgcc, works on linux and windows w/ cygwin
. requires libusb

    * led is optional
	* LP2950 can be replaced by similar 3.3v LDO regulator

FEATURES:

. occupies 2.4k flash space
. requires no external crystal, timer sychronize via usb sync frame
. v-usb like circuitry, BOM (68ohm x 2, 1.5k, 4.7k, LP2950AC3.3, 10uF, 0.1uF, led)
. supports 8k and 16k msp430g2xxx value line devices
. bootloader checks for D- pull-up and usb host presence upon bootup

NOTES:
. change MCU= in Makefiles for target device (g2553, g2342 tested)
. commandline contains host side bootloader code
. apps directory contains sample applications to test firmware bootloading

(2012.12.xx)
  . it started from a thread post in 43oh.com, look for "bit-bang usb"
  . Macrimus-B posted code on a bit-bang usb implementation for msp430
  . oPossum translate assembler code to TI CCS, w/ simplier C entry points
  . myself translate code into mspgcc, implements this bootloader on top

  . initial checkin
